## glSelfLearn  

A self learning repo for OpenGL.  
For a backup of what I've learnt, which is exclusively built on Windows. May add CMake files to support multi-platform in the future.  

------

**Dependencies**  
1. opengl32 (on Windows)  
2. [glew](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)  
3. [glfw3](https://www.glfw.org/)  
4. [soil](http://www.lonesock.net/soil.html) (for image processing)  
5. [glm](https://glm.g-truc.net/index.html) (for mathematics)  
6. [assimp](http://www.assimp.org/) (for model loading)

**Resources**  
All the codes are learnt from [learnopengl](https://learnopengl.com/), a great website for learning OpenGL and useful techniques. I use GLEW instead of GLAD, so I learn it from the downloaded pdf version. Many thanks to the author!
